global caches
Fix spawner to be more module
make tiers for different levels

document all my objects (room, creep etc)

tag extensions structures as going to be filled and prevent other creeps trying to fill them
1. better pathfinding
2. break out spawner


in order to creak the top 10 page 1 need:
6 double rooms ENTIRE output to go to upgrade.
I think an empire of 6 rooms could easily achieve this with the correct upgrade booster things.
