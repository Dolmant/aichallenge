Need to do:
add eslint rules I am dying

tomorrow:
better state machine - once the task is done, return TRUE. If return TRUE, run the roles switch.
Tasks should be run first, then role logic
thiefs should more efficiently go to sources.
graphana
recycle creeps experiment
fix resupply bug due to link going empty for one tick

profiling
make labs do something
make sure moves are more efficient inside of room
auto build roads when over certasin threshold
global caches
Fix spawner to be more module
make tiers for different levels

document all my objects (room, creep etc)
count parts per energy

build a repairer creep
build a map in memory I can use to navigate?

tag extensions structures as going to be filled and prevent other creeps trying to fill them
1. better pathfinding
2. break out spawner
