Need to do:
add eslint rules I am dying

to build roads add work component to mules, mules are going to check as they walk and build it.

tomorrow:
defend from neutral creeps
implement automatic creep production vs enemies

create global controller that can dispatch actions - run regular ones, then process controller
Rather than spawning based on each room, create a spawn dispatcher to more easily figure out where things should spawn.
implement emergeny safe modes (on something breaking, trigger it) 
implement claims for thievery rooms

fix resupply bug due to link going empty for one tick
FIX TODO BS


thiefmules should more efficiently go to sources.
simultaneous actions
profiling
better typing (import one of the screeps type systems)
console log to externally push commands
better state machine? first pass done
make labs do something
make sure moves are more efficient inside of room
auto build roads when over certasin threshold
global caches
Fix spawner to be more module
make tiers for different levels
recycle dead creeps

document all my objects (room, creep etc)
count parts per energy

build a repairer creep
build a map in memory I can use to navigate?

tag extensions structures as going to be filled and prevent other creeps trying to fill them
1. better pathfinding
2. break out spawner


in order to creak the top 10 page 1 need:
6 double rooms ENTIRE output to go to upgrade.
I think an empire of 6 rooms could easily achieve this with the correct upgrade booster things.
