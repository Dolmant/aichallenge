Need to do:
add eslint I am dying
invade bottom
findsources dies when sources run out so will have to identify some other way
document all my objects (room, creep etc)
count parts per energy
create energy invaders
build a repairer creepevery ROLE handles all TASKS
have a better baseline for 6 harvest / 1 upgrade, everything else
tag extensions structures as going to be filled and prevent other creeps trying to fill them
1. better pathfinding
find out what went wrong that caused all creeps to die!
2. break out spawner
3. spawn smarter - what is the optimal config
4. spawn based on incoming energy
5. Work out best combo of parts for things.
6. Global harvest/upgrade/build Game.flags depending on available energy levels and pathfinding
