count parts per energy
create energy invaders
build a repairer creepevery ROLE handles all TASKS
have a better baseline for 6 harvest / 1 upgrade, everything else
1. better pathfinding
find out what went wrong that caused all creeps to die!
2. break out spawner
3. spawn smarter - what is the optimal config
4. spawn based on incoming energy
5. Work out best combo of parts for things.
