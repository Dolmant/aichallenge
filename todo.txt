Need to do:
add eslint rules I am dying

tomorrow:
types
global caches
Fix spawner to be more module
make tiers for different levels
all tasks should delete themselves when done.
All roles should assign new tasks only if the previous task has been deleted
Tasks should be run first, then role logic

build flow types

document all my objects (room, creep etc)
count parts per energy

build a repairer creepevery ROLE handles all TASKS
have a better baseline for max 12 harvest per with a limit of 4
tag extensions structures as going to be filled and prevent other creeps trying to fill them
1. better pathfinding
2. break out spawner
3. spawn smarter - what is the optimal config
4. spawn based on incoming energy
5. Work out best combo of parts for things.
6. Global harvest/upgrade/build Game.flags depending on available energy levels and pathfinding
